# Quantum

Quantum is a framework to manage Atomic's [TrueAuth](https://www.trueauth.com/) technology. With Quantum, you can create and manage your own TrueAuth browsers.

There are two packages required to use Quantum:
1. Either [QuantumIOS](https://github.com/atomicfi/quantum-ios) or QuantumAndroid
2. [QuantumJS](https://github.com/atomicfi/quantum-js)

This repo provides examples of how to integrate the native SDKs and the web layer that allows Quantum to function.
